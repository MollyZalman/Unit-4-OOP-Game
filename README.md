# Unit 4 OOP Game
 Using JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.
# Project title
OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Game

## Why?
This project showcases my capability to use vanilla Javascript without any plug-ins to make an interactive, fun and user-friendly game. This also shows my ability to make a project my own, and design as I like.

## Motivation
My forth project for the Team Treehouse Tech Degree in Full Stack JavaScript.
