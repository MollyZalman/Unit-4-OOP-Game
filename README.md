# Unit 4 OOP Game
 Using JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.
# Project title
OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Game

## Why?
This project showcases my capability to use vanilla Javascript without any plug-ins to make an interactive, fun and user-friendly game. This also shows my ability to make a project my own, and design as I like.

## Motivation
My forth project for the Team Treehouse Tech Degree in Full Stack JavaScript.

### Features and Personalization
Since it's October, I wanted to make a Halloween theme. So I changed the keys to a spooky green as well as the neutral and win colors. I changed the background color to orange, like a pumpkin is, and same for the btn__reset class. For contrast I also included orange as the start background color, the overlay and the title to white. The winning color is purple, and the losing background is a sheer red. For extras, when the keys are chosen and they match the phrase, they turn purple, if they're wrong they turn red. I really wanted to change the font to make it super scary but I wasn't sure how to accomplish this and couldn't find any resources to make the font work beyond a local scope. This will be a fun project for me to try to solve in the meantime.

Thank you to Richard Clark for the reset.css file as well as the wonderful team at Treehouse.
